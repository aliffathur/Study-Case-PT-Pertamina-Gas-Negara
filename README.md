In this repository, I will share the case study I worked on, which is a system for finding potential customers for PT Pertamina Gas Negara

As a Product Manager, I attempted a case study to analyze the business process of PT Pertamina Gas Negara with the aim of enhancing efficiency in finding potential customers in need of gas supply. 
Through a series of market research and needs analysis, I gained a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities in this industry.
Armed with this understanding, I decided to develop a technology-based solution to help PT Pertamina Gas Negara achieve its business objectives. 
In a dual role as Product Manager and UI Designer, I designed a product concept that integrates attractive UI elements with strong functionality.

As a UI Designer, I paid special attention to designing intuitive and appealing user interfaces. I crafted clean layouts and easy-to-understand navigation, 
as well as introduced captivating visual elements to enhance the overall user experience. At every step, I ensured that the UI design not only reflects the PT Pertamina Gas Negara brand,
but also meets the needs and preferences of potential users.

Next, I designed and developed a product prototype that allowed us to test the concept directly with the target audience. I ensured that the UI design could be smoothly implemented in the final product. 
Through continuous iteration and adjustment, I was able to produce a prototype that combines attractive UI design with effective functionality.
This design served as a medium for my learning and provided insights into how the product could be further developed to not only assist PT Pertamina Gas Negara in finding potential customers more efficiently,
but also strengthen the company's reputation as an industry leader. This collaborative process not only enriched my experience as a Product Manager and UI Designer but also had a significant positive impact on the company and its potential customers.
